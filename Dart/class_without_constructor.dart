/**
 * A class is used to construct objects like map, lists, sets, etc.
 * A Dart class is created using `class` keyword.
 * A Dart class automatically inherits from `Object` class.
 * A Dart class constructor has the same name as the class.
 * Any properties defined without a `static` keyword are instance properties.
 *
 * An object from a class is created using `ClassName()` or `new ClassName()` syntax.
 * Sicne Dart v2, `new` keyword to create an object is optional.
 *
 * `this` keyword inside an instance method points to the object itself.
 * `@override` annotation is used to mark a method that is overriding the method defined in the inherited class.
 * 
 * ðŸ”¥ TIPS:
 * 1. All static variables and methods are accessible by their names directly in static or instance methods.
 * 2. All instance variables and methods are accessible by their names directly in instance methods.
 * 3. It is recommended to use `this` to remove ambiguity between function parameters and static/instance variables.
